    <p>Maintaining social order through formal justice systems cuts directly to the core of “what states do.” Yet in many contexts, high crime rates, low trust in justice system institutions, and/or widespread forms of human rights violations suggest failures of formal justice sector institutions spanning from prisons, courts, and police. My work on the justice sector seeks to: (1) theorize the institutional causes of such outcomes and (2) use interventions aimed to improve outcomes to illuminate these dynamics.</p>

<h3> Legal Assistance and Pretrial Detention in Haiti </h3>

    Offices and case files of detainees in Haitian Courts of First Instance, 2015.
</div>

<p>In Haiti, 8,000 individuals – over 70% of the prison population – are held in illegal prolonged pretrial detention, meaning that they have not yet been tried and their confinement exceeds constitutional time limits for pretrial detention. While the situation in Haiti is dire, such illegal pretrial detention represents the largest form of illegal detention globally and is not well explained by existing theories of human rights violation.</p>

<p>In contrast to repression-based logics for human rights violation, Chris Fariss and I propose a misgovernance logic for this form of detention. We argue that moral hazard problems of justice system actors and the institutional structure of the courts of first instance exacerbate constraints on the courts’ ability to process and investigate cases, leading to backlogs and overruns of constitutional time limits.</p>

<p>We test the implications of this theory through 88 semi-structured interviews across five Haitian court jurisdictions and novel randomized-rollout experiment in collaboration with USAID that provided free legal assistance to the illegally detained. The legal assistance targeted low-level bureaucrats within the Courts of First Instance. We find no evidence of an intent to detain these individuals. Further, we estimate that cases advance in proportion to the dosage of legal assistance received and that legal assistance reduces the probability that an individual remains detained after 9 months. To the extent that an intervention targeted at low-level bureaucrats is effective in accelerating cases, the evidence supports our argument about misgovernance and rights.</p>
