I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. I study comparative politics, quantitative methods, and political economy (formal theory).

I write on the political economy of institutions and development. My dissertation focuses on the distributive politics of the bureaucracy with application to low- and middle-income democracies. I have conducted fieldwork in Argentina, Colombia, Haiti, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, and Venezuela.

My graduate studies are supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Individual projects have benefitted from generous support from NSF, USAID, EGAP/DFID, J-PAL, the Columbia Institute for Latin American Studies (ILAS), the Center for the Study of Development Strategies (CSDS), and the Columbia Department of Political Science. I am a Steering Committee member (PI) in the current [Metaketa-III Natural Resource Governance](http://egap.org/metaketa/metaketa-iii-natural-resource-governance), overseeing coordinated studies in six countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

Before graduate school, I was a professional violinist. I earned both a BM in Violin Performance and a BA in Political Science from Rice University in 2012. After graduating, I worked as a violin teacher and strings coach for [Fundación Nacional Batuta](https://www.fundacionbatuta.org/) all over Bogotá, Colombia. I continue to explore lesser-played works in the solo (unaccompanied) violin repertoire and give the occasional house concert.
