I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University, Predoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Visiting Scholar at New York University. I will start as Assistant Professor of Politics at NYU in 2020.

I write on the political economy of institutions and development. My dissertation focuses on the distributive politics of the bureaucracy with application to low- and middle-income democracies. I have conducted fieldwork in Argentina, Colombia, Haiti, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, and Venezuela.

My graduate studies are supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Individual projects have benefitted from generous support from NSF, USAID, EGAP/DFID, J-PAL, the Columbia Institute for Latin American Studies (ILAS), the Center for the Study of Development Strategies (CSDS), and the Columbia Department of Political Science.

Before graduate school, I was a professional violinist. I earned both a BM in Violin Performance and a BA in Political Science from Rice University in 2012.
