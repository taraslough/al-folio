I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Politics at New York University.

I write on the political economy of institutions and development. My current research focuses on the comparative study of bureaucracy and research design. I have conducted fieldwork in Argentina, Colombia, Haiti, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, and Venezuela.

My research has been supported by NSF, USAID, EGAP/DFID, J-PAL, the Columbia Institute for Latin American Studies (ILAS), the Center for the Study of Development Strategies (CSDS), and the Columbia Department of Political Science. My graduate studies were supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. 

I recently earned my PhD from Columbia University. Before graduate school, I was a professional violinist. I earned both a BM in Violin Performance and a BA in Political Science from Rice University.
