<h3> Work on the Amazon </h3>
Deforestation in the Amazon represents one of the most salient manifestations of uneven state capacity in Latin America. Two projects in the Amazon in Brazil and Peru examine the manifestations of state-citizen interactions in the region.

First, I examine temporal and spatial variation in the Brazilian state’s enforcement capacity empirically in a paper with Johannes Urpelainen. Employing a difference-in-difference research design with Brazil’s Priority Municipalities ties program, we examine spillover effects in areas outside priority municipalities. Using remote-sensed satellite data on forest loss over almost a decade, we find that in areas proximate to targeted municipalities, deforestation decreased due to the program, but as distance from the border increases, deforestation increases. The findings suggest that capacity emerges in the context of a strategic relationship between a state and its subjects (here deforesters).

Second, in a field experiment in the Peruvian Amazon with Jacob Kopas, Johannes Urpelainen, and Rainforest Foundation US, I examine the effects of bringing this type of forest loss data to the communities most immediately impacted. While substantial investments have been made in satellite monitoring to detect deforestation events in the region, much of this data remains inaccessible to "first responders,'' namely communities in the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the officials tasked with prosecuting these crimes. We ask two questions:
<li>
To what extent does providing this information to the communities most threatened by deforestation and facilitating community monitoring allow communities to respond to such threats and combat continued deforestation?
</li>
<li>
Does facilitating contact between affected communities and government authorities promote increased legal action against offenders?
</li>

<h3> Metaketa-III </h3>

The Peru project represents one of six harmonized community monitoring interventions in Metaketa-III. I joined the steering committee overseeing the six projects in October 2017.
