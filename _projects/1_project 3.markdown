From roads to education to social services, public goods provided by states can promote welfare and combat inequality. By the same token, when under provided, inefficient, or poorly targeted, these same goods and services can reduce welfare and entrench inequalities. Dominant approaches to the study of these pathologies have focused on politicians’ incentives to provide these goods. I instead focus on the state institutions themselves to understand how and why poor outcomes emerge.

My dissertation studies the distributive politics of bureaucracy in precisely these settings focusing on: (1) bureaucratic discretion in the production and distribution of public goods; and (2) the targeting of public sector jobs as private goods.

<h4> Bureaucratic Discretion and Public Service Provision </h4>

Bureaucrat-citizen interaction represent the most regular form of interaction between citizens and their governments. Street-level bureaucrats oversee service delivery in these encounters, often with substantial discretion over the distribution of these goods and services. To what extent does bureaucratic discretion shape inequality in access to public goods and services? How do these considerations shape politicians’ decisions to allocate funds to public goods?

<h4> Public Jobs as Private Goods </h4>

The second portion of the dissertation examines the politics of bureaucratic selection within the frame of distributive politics. It starts from the observation that public sector jobs represent the largest form of targeted distribution in most democracies. Nevertheless, we know least about who wins public sector jobs in precisely the places where they are most lucrative: low- and middle-income countries. In these settings, public sector wage premia – the difference between average public and private sector wages – are greatest. I argue that at the national level, politicians employ three main policy instruments to shape the composition of the bureaucracy: merit requirements/civil service reforms, affirmative action policies or quotas, and public sector wages.
