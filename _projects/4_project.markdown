In two papers, I examine how the strategies adopted by political parties change from election to election. These papers employ dynamic formal models of intraparty governance to explain primary adoption and platform (re)positioning, respectively.

 A paper, "A Dynamic Model of Primaries" with Michael Ting and Erin York, examines the adoption of primaries in contexts in which parties adopt primaries in a decentralized manner. The graph above shows that in many democracies, primary adoption is a party-level (decentralized) decision. Further, parties choose whether or not to hold primaries election by election.
Why do parties adopt primaries in these environments? To explain these patterns in a dynamic environment, we adopt an infinite horizon model of primary adoption that explores a central trade off: primaries produce more electable candidates but losing a primary deprives party elites of private goods (rents) and future elite status. We show that parties adopt primaries when electorally disadvantaged and when polarization increases.

A second paper, "After Defeat: Governing Party Response to Electoral Loss" with Yotam Margalit and Michael Ting studies how governing parties in advanced industrialized democracies respond to loss of power (governing status). In empirical analyses, we find that parties disproportionately shift to the extreme after losing power. We find suggestive evidence that these shifts are mediated by the size of the party leadership selectorate. To organize these empirical findings, we introduce a dynamic model of party leadership selection and platform positioning. We analyze equilibrium of the model as a Markov chain. The long-run distribution of the Markov chain allows us to simulate the probability of platform shifts in response to electoral events (loss of power). The theoretical results generally align with empirical findings under plausible parameter settings.
